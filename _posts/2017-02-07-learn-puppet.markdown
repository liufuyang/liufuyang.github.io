## What is puppet?

* It's a software piece that allows automation. You configure a central server
and the clients synchronize themselves to it.
* It's a descriptive system. You decide that a file should be there, with some 
permissions, content, that a software package should be installed, and at each run,
the system ensures that it ends in the state you have described.
