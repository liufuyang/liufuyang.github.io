## What is puppet?

* It's a software piece that allows automation. You configure a central server
and the clients synchronize themselves to it.
* It's a descriptive system. You decide that a file should be there, with some 
permissions, content, that a software package should be installed, and at each run,
the system ensures that it ends in the state you have described.

## Getting started

Let's try learn some puppet via this youtube video:

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }
</style>
<div class="embed-container">
  <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" 
    src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Hiu_ui2nZa0" 
    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>
</div>
<br>


## Prepare a AWS EC2 for hands on learning
As suggested in the video, one should setup an AWS EC2 for the hands on session.
