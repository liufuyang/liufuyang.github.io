Just another Tensorflow beginner guide. As for myself I found it is difficult to find a step-by-step, easy to follow and practical-things-focused guide on Tensorflow 1.0, I decide to node some stuff down while learning Tensorflow so hopefully it can help me or somebody else out there as well.

You are expected to have some Python background to be able to follow this guide. And it is for mac users. Linux and Windows user will need to change some of the installation commands accordingly. But those information are easy to find.

## Part1 - Installation and simple example

This tutorial is mean for Tensorflow 1.0.1 with Python 3.4. Other version might work as well but I highly recommend you try use the same version to avoid potential issues. 

You are welcome come to leave comments below and I will try my best to update the post if it can help others.

Before following the following guide, you might also want to take a look at the official installation guide as well at [www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac)

### Install Python 3 (highly recommended)
As Python3 have many good features, let's just install the latest version of python 3 from [www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first. Head to the link then click the download v3.6 button for example, then install it.

Afterwards you should have this output in terminal:
```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.6.0
```
It's totally okay for now if your `python --version` is still 2.7, we will use `virtualenvs` later to make sure your `python --version` will output version 3 info.


### Install `virtualenvs` (highly recommended)

This `virtualenvs` is highly recommended as it allows different projects on your computer to have different Python environment. You may checkout this http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/ or just do:

```
$ pip3 install virtualenv
```

### Install autoenv (highly recommended)

This `autoenv`tool is also highly recommended as it automatically switch the correct python environment for you when you cd into a folder. It uses a config file called `.env` file in your project directory, to switch shell Python environment to desired environment. Check it out here at [https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) or just try install like this:
```
$ brew install autoenv
$ echo "source $(brew --prefix autoenv)/activate.sh" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

### Create a Python env for your Tensorflow learning project

Good, now we almost have everything ready, close all the shells you have opened and open a new one (which will make sure all the previous installation applied).

Then make yourself a project folder for continuing with. I will call my **`tf-learn`** (you can name it whatever you want), and in that folder, we create a virtual environment called **`tf-venv`** (again, you can name it whatever you want)
```shell
$ cd tf-learn
$ virtualenv -p python3 tf-venv
```

Then make a **`.env`** file to make `autoenv` work for you:
```shell
$ echo source `pwd`/tf-venv/bin/activate > .env
$ cat .env
```
You should see some output like `source /Users/fuyang/Workspace/tf-learn/tf-venv/bin/activate`

Then, simply try cd one more level up and back again:
```shell
$ cd ..
$ cd tf-learn
autoenv:
autoenv: WARNING:
autoenv: This is the first time you are about to source /Users/fuyang/tf-learn/.env:
autoenv:     source /Users/fuyang/tf-learn/tf-venv/bin/activate$
autoenv: Are you sure you want to allow this? (y/N)
```
just input `y` and enter. Then you should see `(tf-env)` shows up in front of your bash note. (Remember you can use command `$ deactivate` to deactivate the environment anytime you are within it, for example when you cd into other directories and you want your `$ python --version` to be system version again.)

Verify again with these commands:
```shell
$ which python
/Users/fuyang/tf-learn/tf-venv/bin/python

$ which pip
/Users/fuyang/tf-learn/tf-venv/bin/pip

$ python --version
Python 3.6.0
```
If you have info show up like that, perfect. 

### Install Tensorflow v1.0.1:

More info here [https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac) or just do:
```
$ pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
$ pip show tensorflow
```
Alternatively if you want to use a newer version of tensorflow then just do `pip install --upgrade tensorflow` instead use the url with pip shown above.

`pip show tensorflow` Should now output info such as:
```
Name: tensorflow
Version: 1.0.1
Summary: TensorFlow helps the tensors flow
Home-page: http://tensorflow.org/
Author: Google Inc.
Author-email: opensource@google.com
License: Apache 2.0
Location: /Users/fuyang/tf-learn/tf-venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages
Requires: numpy, wheel, six, protobuf
```
Congratulations, now you have a tensorflow 1.0.1 installed.

### A very simple example:
Now let's take a look at a very simple example. Before going further, you might want to checkout these links to learn more from there:
[https://pythonprogramming.net/tensorflow-introduction-machine-learning-tutorial/](https://pythonprogramming.net/tensorflow-introduction-machine-learning-tutorial/)
[http://jorditorres.org/first-contact-with-tensorflow/](http://jorditorres.org/first-contact-with-tensorflow/)

Never the less, let's try this simple example in a file `example-1-basic.py` then run it with `python example-1-basic.py`

```python
# example-1-basic.py
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.placeholder("float")
b = tf.placeholder("float")

y = tf.multiply(a, b)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(y, feed_dict={a: 6, b: 7})
    print(result)
```



By running it you should see an output of **`42.0`**. (You might also see some tensorflow warning messages but I think we can neglect them for now.)

Great, now we have a tensorflow super basic program working!
